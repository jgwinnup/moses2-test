Moses2 server test

Use the perl script to send a high-volume stream of translation requests to moses2 running in server mode - run both on the same machine to max throughput, 

We're using an input file of 5k lines and call the script like this:

./moses_translate.pl --maxjobs 4 http://localhost:6003/RPC2 < (head -n650 testfile )

I've included a sample moses2.ini, but any local one you have should be fine.

If everything crashes correctly, you should get a core dump, the backtrace should look like the one in moses2.backtrace
